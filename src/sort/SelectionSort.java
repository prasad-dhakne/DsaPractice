// time complexity  
// best case -  O(n^2)
// worst case - O(n^2)
// is stable - no
// stable means after sorting, the order should be the same for same value element
// that means there are two ten in arrays first is red and second is blue, then after sorting the red 10 must be first
// use case - It performs well on small list and arrays
